Most credit for this goes to webultra for finding the library, writing the initial code and providing me
with a very good example. I simply refactored a lot of the code and made it work on a 'object' model.

To make this work, you must install it and copy the spawner-ex.dll to the AutoPlay\Docs folder of your
project.
